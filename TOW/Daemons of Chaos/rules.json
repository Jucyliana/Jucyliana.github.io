Against enemy shooting, use the armour value of the majority of the models in the unit.\nCasualty Removal: Against enemy shooting, casualty removal should be divided as equally as possible between the different models within the unit. In combat, casualties should be removed from among the majority of the models that make up the fighting rank. In either case, available models are brought forward from rear ranks to fill any gaps, as chosen by the controlling player.\n"
