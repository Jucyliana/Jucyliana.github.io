Each time an OFFICER model issues an Order, select one of the Orders below, then select one eligible friendly unit within 6\" of that OFFICER model to issue it to. OFFICER models can issue Orders in your Command phase and at the end of a phase in which they disembarked from a TRANSPORT or were set up on the battlefield.\n\nUntil the start of your next Command phase, the unit you selected is affected by that Order. Unless otherwise stated, a unit can only be affected by one Order at a time (any Order subsequently issued to that unit replaces the current one). Orders cannot be issued to Battle-shocked units, and if a unit being affected by an Order becomes Battle-shocked, that Order ceases to affect that unit.\n\nMOVE! MOVE! MOVE!\nAdd 3\" to the Move characteristic of models in this unit.\n\nFIX BAYONETS!\nImprove the Weapon Skill characteristic of melee weapons equipped by models in this unit by 1.\n\nTAKE AIM!\nImprove the Ballistic Skill characteristic of ranged weapons equipped by models in this unit by 1.\n\nFIRST RANK, FIRE! SECOND RANK, FIRE!\nImprove the Attacks characteristic of Rapid Fire weapons equipped by models in this unit by 1.\n\nTAKE COVER!\nImprove the Save characteristic of models in this unit by 1 (this cannot improve a model’s Save to better than 3+).\n\nDUTY AND HONOUR!\nImprove the Leadership and Objective Control characteristics of models in this unit by 1."
