    "Description": "There are three different Move Manoeuvres. When a unit moves in the Movement Phase, it must select which Move Manoeuvres it will perform:\n-   Advance Move, \n-   March Move, or\n-   Reform Move.\nRemember that since you are allowed to perform any measurements at any time, it's possible to test a Move Manoeuvre, realise it was not a great idea, and then immediately backtrack and perform a different Move Manoeuvre, unless random events or decisions by the opponent has happened that could influence the decision. It is also customary to mark the starting position, so that backtracking is possible to do accurately.\n\nReform Moves is where a unit tactically adjusts their arrangement on the field, granting them the strategic edge to adapt to new challenges during battle. This controlled shift is used to optimise positioning, formation and facing, white staying mostly in the same spot. \\\nAdvance Moves provide units with the freedom to manoeuvre on the battlefield, making it a versatile choice for repositioning when preparing to engage with the enemy.\\\nMarch Moves are the fastest but least flexible movement option available to a unit. It allows the unit to move quickly in a forward direction.\nValid Final Position\nFor the final position of the unit to be considered a valid position, regardless of which Move Manoeuvre was performed, the following condition must be met. If not, the Move Manoeuvre cannot be performed.\n-   Each corner of the unit’s end position must be within twice its Mobility value (2xMob inches) of at least one corner’s starting position. Note that a  corner need  not be within 2xMob inches of the same corner's starting position.\nFor simplicity, measure the corner that is furthest away from the starting position, and measure towards the starting position of the closest corner.\n\n\nReferenceManualColorExample of how to measure Valid Final PositionThe unit moves forward and wheels to face right. When reaching the end position, make sure that the corner that travelled furthest is still within 2xMob of at least one of the corners of the unit's starting position (marked in red dashed line in the figure).\n\n\nAdvance Move\nWhen performing an Advance Move, execute the following actions in the order given below:\n1 -  Pivot: The Advance Move is initiated with a Pivot. At the end of this pivot, the unit must follow the Unit Spacing rule (note that since this is partway through a move, the unit may normally be up to within 0.5\" from other units).\n2 -  Snaking Forward Move (Mob): After the Pivot, the unit may do  any number of Snaking Forward Moves, with a distance no more than equal to its Mobility (in inches). While performing these Snaking Forward Moves, the direction the unit is facing must stay within 90 degrees (in either direction) from the direction the unit was facing after the Pivot.\n3 -  Reorder: Models may be repositioned within the unit, as long as the number of files does not change.\nMarch Move\nWhen performing a March Move, execute the following actions in the order given below:\n1 -  Snaking Forward Move (2xMob): The unit may do any number of Snaking Forward Moves, with a total distance no more than equal to twice its Mobility (in inches). While performing these Snaking Forward Moves, the direction the unit is facing must stay within 90 degrees (in either direction) from the direction the unit was facing before the March Move.\\\n2 -  Reorder: Models may be repositioned within the unit, as long as the number of files does not change. \\\nReform Move\nTo do a Reform Move, pick the unit up from the battlefield and put it back with the following restrictions:\n-   The centre of the unit can not travel further than half the unit's Mobility (see Characteristic Profiles in the Definitions and Terminology chapter).\n-   The formation of the unit may change only as long as the number of Files has not changed by more than 2 . Remember that the unit cannot voluntarily have more Ranks than Files unless the unit is wide enough to have a Proper Rank (see Models and Units in the Definitions and Terminology chapter).\n-   Each model is considered to have moved from its starting position to end position, around obstructions where needed, and no single model can move further than twice its Mobility.\nWhen measuring each model's move, it is considered to move independently of its unit, in any direction or combination of directions, including side- and back-stepping. The models can ignore other models from the same unit, but not from other units. No single model can move further than twice its Mobility. Measure the centre of each model's base, and measure the path the model moves on the Battlefield, from starting to ending position, including the path winding around obstacles.\nTreat each model as an individual unit following the Unit Spacing rule. At the end of this move, all models come back together again into a viable formation as described above.\nReferenceManualColorSimplified Reform Move\\\nIn practice, for the vast majority of Reform and Advance Moves, there is no  need to consider the movements of individual models.\\\nThe Upper example shows the technical way to perform a Reform Move; moving models one by one (grey dotted lines), and measuring distance the centre moved (black dotted line). \\\nThe Lower image show a simplified method to perform a Reform Move: Move the unit as a whole, potentially readjusting formation by adding or removing files. Measure the distance the centre travels, while making sure that no model moves further than its Mobility * 2, typically by measuring the distance of the models that have travelled the furthest.\\\nReferenceManualColorExample of Reform Move\nMid-Reform Move Actions\nIf, for any reasons, a model's position is relevant during a mid-Reform Move, such as during a Sweeping Attack or Dangerous Terrain Tests, the unit must be placed in a viable formation and following the Unit Spacing rule (0.5\") at the point where it becomes relevant, before continuing the move. If it cannot be placed, the move cannot be performed. When measuring the distance each model moves, measure from starting position, to the position it is placed mid-move, and then finally to its ending position."

    "Description": "Spells are divided into two types.\n-   Learned Spells: The most common type, these are cast using the full power of the Veil.\n-   Bound Spells: Bound into an object or creature and more stable than Learned spells, since they are cast using only parts of the Veil. These are cast by all manner of creatures, as well as some Wizards.\nMost spells belong to a specific Path of Magic (see  the Arcane Compendium), or are an Hereditary spell unique to each Army Book.\n\nCasting and Dispelling\nEach of Active Player's models with one or more spells can attempt to cast each spell up to once per Magic Phase. (Remember that Shaken models cannot cast spells.) The sequence for casting a spell is as follows:\nWell no, I’m not a magician myself; I am a scholar, and one of the finest minds in Avras, I’ll have you know! And I have read all there is to know about magic, including the drivel that Heisermann calls his magnum opus.\nAny true wizard will tell you that magic comes at a cost; too much of the stuff is lethal. It’s a mutagenic poison, after all. A withering, corrupting substance. And those with the proper training can feel the limits of what their body can tolerate instinctively – they cannot use more than is good for them any more than you could stop breathing.\n1012Casting Roll - Active Player\n1 -  Caster and target: Declare which model is casting what spell, and choose target(s) for the spell. See Spell Types in the  Arcane Compendium for details.\n2 -  Spend Magic Dice to cast: Declare how many Magic Dice are spent on the Casting Roll (between 2 - 5 Magic Dice can be used)\n3 -  Roll Dice: Roll the Magic Dice used for the Casting Roll, and add the results together. If the total is equal to or above the spell’s Casting Value, the casting is successful. Otherwise, the Casting Roll failed, go directly to step 7.\n-   Fizzle: If one or more  ‘1’ was rolled, and the Casting Roll was not successful, each dice that rolled a  ‘1’ is added back to the Magic Dice pool.\n-   Miscast: If three or more Magic Dice, or two Magic Dice if using only two dice, used for the Casting Roll gave an identical result, and the Casting Roll is successful, and the spell is not dispelled, the Caster suffers a Miscast. Consult the Miscast Table for further instructions.\n1012Dispelling Roll - Reactive Player\n4 -  Spend Magic Dice to dispel: The Reactive Player may try to Dispel the Spell. If not, go directly to step 6. If the Reactive Player chooses to try the dispelling, declare how many Magic Dice are spent on the Dispelling Roll. Note that there are no limits to how many or how few Magic Dice the Reactive Player may use for this.\n5 -  Dispelling Roll: Roll the Magic Dice used for the Dispelling Roll, and add the results together. If the total is equal to or above the Casting Roll, the dispel is successful, proceed to step 7. Otherwise, the Dispelling Roll failed, proceed to step 6.\n-   Fizzle: If one or more ‘1’ was rolled,  and the Dispelling Roll was not successful, each dice that rolled a ‘1’ is added back to the Magic Dice pool.\n1012Resolving the spell effect\n6 -  Apply spell Effects: If the Casting Roll was successful, and the spell was not not dispelled, it is successfully cast. Apply the spell Effects.\nSpell effects are never affected by any effects affecting the Caster, including Magic Items, Model Rules, other Spell effects, or similar abilities, unless specifically stated otherwise.\n7 -  Next Casting: Afterward, the Active Player may attempt to cast other spells, provided there are enough Magic Dice left.\nCasting Multiple Instances of the same Spell\nEach Caster can only try to cast each of its Learned Spells once per Magic Phase, and it may try to cast a Bound Spell once for each time it has it. If multiple Casters knows the same Spell, all of them may try to cast their instance(s) of the Spell.\nWhen making an attempt to cast a Learned Spell where a version of the same spell (either Bound or Learned) has already been attempted (successfully or not), then the Casting Roll reduced by 3. This is reduced by another 3 for each additional attempt in the same phase. For example, if 2 instances of a spell have been attempted, the Casting Roll is reduced by 6.\nIf instead attempting to cast a Bound Spell, the Casting Roll is only reduced by 1, instead of by 3, for each time a version of the same spell has already been tried.\nRemember that Replicable Spells ignore this modifier but still count as a casting.\nBound Spells\nCasting and Dispelling Bound Spells follow the normal procedure for Casting a Learned Spell, with the following exceptions:\n-   When trying to cast a Bound Spell one Magic Die is a D6, the rest are D3. For example, if Casting a Bound Spell with 3 Magic Dice, roll 1D6 and 2D3.\n-   A rolled D3 can never fizzle.\n-   Bound Spells have their own Casting Values, defined in the brackets following Bound Spell.\n-   Bound Spells can never Miscast.\nWhen Casting a Bound Spell version of a Learned Spell that was already cast in the same Magic Phase, the Casting Roll is decreased only by 1 (instead of by 3).\nNote: When Casting a Learned Spell version of a Bound Spell that was already cast in the same Magic Phase, the Casting Roll is decreased by 3, as usual.  This is ignored if the Bound Spell is Replicable.\nBound Spells are designed to offer low-resource and low-risk casting opportunities to the players. They typically require fewer dice for casting and never cause Miscasts. However, they are also easier to dispel. As a result, Bound Spells are the perfect tool when the opponent is out of Magic Dice for dispelling.\nWhen casting Bound Spells, it is important to clearly differentiate between the D6 and D3 dice. Announce to the opponent how you roll your dice, and either roll them separately, use differently coloured dice, or use dedicated D3-only dice."

If more than one is applicable, apply the uppermost one.\nThe <u><link=\"unit_spacing\">Unit Spacing</link></u> rule is ignored when doing this check and for all movement during Forward Ahead.\n-   Enemy unit: If the first obstacle would be the Unit Boundary of an enemy unit that did not Flee from the same Combat, the Pursuing unit declares a Charge against that unit using its Pursuit Distance roll as its <u><link=\"charge_range\">Charge Range</link></u>. If there is more than one possible target, the Pursuing unit chooses which to Charge. The Charged unit may not perform any <u><link=\"charge_reactions\">Charge Reactions</link></u>.\nThe Pursuing unit immediately performs a <u><link=\"charge_move\">Charge Move</link></u> towards the previously determined Facing, following all the normal <u><link=\"charge_move\">Charge Move</link></u> and Align Move rules described in the <u><link=\"charge_phase\">Charge Phase</link></u> chapter, (including Unaligned Charge and <u><link=\"blocked_path\">Blocked Path</link></u> if applicable). If the Charge is not possible to complete, the unit does not perform a <u><link=\"failed_charge_move\">Failed Charge Move</link></u> but treats the enemy unit as Obstruction instead, see below.\nIf the Pursuing unit joins a Combat that has already been fought or was created during this <u><link=\"melee_phase\">Melee Phase</link></u>, it will be resolved in the next <u><link=\"melee_phase\">Melee Phase</link></u>, with the Charging unit still counting as Charging. If the Pursuing unit joins a Combat that was not created during this <u><link=\"melee_phase\">Melee Phase</link></u> and that has not been fought yet, the unit will have a chance to fight and Pursue again this phase.\n-   <u><link=\"table_edge\">Table Edge</link></u>: If the first obstacle would be the <u><link=\"table_edge\">Table Edge</link></u>, move the unit straight forward until it touches the <u><link=\"table_edge\">Table Edge</link></u>, and then immediately perform a Post-Combat <u><link=\"pivot\">Pivot</link></u>.\n-   Obstruction : If the first obstacle would be an Obstruction, move the unit straight forward until just before it enters base contact with the Obstruction.\n-   Free to move: If the Front Facing of the Pursuing unit touches neither of the above,  move the unit straight forward its Pursuit Distance.\n\n3. Legal Position?\nAt the end of the Pursue Move, check if the unit is in a legal position following the <u><link=\"unit_spacing\">Unit Spacing</link></u> rule. It cannot be in contact with an enemy unit it did not declare a Charge against, but can be within 0.5\" of units and <u><link=\"impassable_terrain\">Impassable Terrain</link></u> , this  includes friendly units that were part of the same Combat.

The owner of the winning units chooses to roll for unit A’s Pursuit Distance first. 6\" is not enough to catch the Fleeing unit.

Unit C's Pursuit Distance is 5\".\\\\\nb) When checking which units will Charge an enemy unit during their Pursuit, before moving any Pursuing unit, it turns out that both unit A and unit B will Charge unit E, so both units declare a Charge against unit E. Unit C will not Charge any enemy units. \\\\\nc) Now units A and B perform their Pursuit Moves first. During this move, they can move through one another ignoring the <u><link=\"unit_spacing\">Unit Spacing</link></u> rule. Otherwise, they move using the normal rules for <u><link=\"charge_moves\">Charge Moves</link></u> (one Wheel allowed, Maximising Contact). In order to maximise the number of <u><link=\"model\">models</link></u> and units in base contact, unit A aligns its Front Facing with unit E’s, while unit B moves into corner to corner contact with unit E. Afterwards unit C <u><link=\"pivot\">Pivots</link></u> and moves its Pursuit Distance straight forward."

    "Description": "When wounds are inflicted on a unit, there are two types of saves that the defender can make to potentially negate the damage: Armour Saves and Special Saves.\nWhen taking saves, the owner of the attacked model rolls a D6 and compares it with the needed score to pass the save. See the details below for how to pass Armour Saves and Special Saves.\nIf successful, the wound is ignored. First roll Armour Save, and then, if this is not passed, roll the  Special Save. If the Special Save is failed, or the model does not have a Special Save, a wound is inflicted. Proceed to Losing Health Points and Casualties.\n\nArmour Saves\nThe defender rolls Armour Saves, by rolling a D6 for each wound, and comparing the result with the model’s Armour Value, reduced by the Attack's Armour Penetration.\nThe modified Armour Value describes the number of sides on a D6, counting down from the highest value, that will result in a successful roll, see tables below. If the Armor Save is successful, the wound is ignored. However, a natural roll of ‘1’ is considered a failure.\nArm - AP    Armour Save Roll\n5 or above    2+\n4    3+\n3    4+\n2    5+\n1    6+\n0    Cannot be passed  \nAP 0    AP 1    AP 2    AP 3    AP 4    AP 5    AP 6\nArm 0    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A\nArm 1    6+    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A\nArm 2    5+    6+    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A\nArm 3    4+    5+    6+    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A\nArm 4    3+    4+    5+    6+    N/A    N/A    N/A\nArm 5    2+    3+    4+    5+    6+    N/A    N/A\nArm 6    2+    2+    3+    4+    5+    6+    N/A  \nFor example, Armour 3, means that ‘6’, ‘5’, and ‘4’ would be successful Armour Save rolls. If the model is attacked by Armour Penetration 1, its Armour is reduced to Armour 2, which now means that ‘6’ and ‘5’ are successful Armour Save rolls. \nThis is equivalent with using the formula below to determine the required roll to negate the wound:\n7 - (Defender’s Armor)\n+ (Attacker’s Armour Penetration)\nCombined Armour\nEach model has a base Armour value in its profile, and some models may have additional equipment, rules, or are under the effect of spells that modify the Armour values. Different sources of Armour can be combined, adding up to the total combined Armour.\nFor example, a model with a base Armour of 3 that is under the effect of a spell that grants +1 Armour, has a combined Armour of 4. When wounded by an attack with Armour Penetration 1, the Armour Save roll would be ‘4’, ‘5’, or ‘6’ (or 4+).\nSpecial Saves\nIf a wound is not saved by the Armour Save, the defender may negate the attack with its Special Save, if it has one. Special Saves work like Armour saves, except they are unaffected by Armour Penetration.\nA natural roll of ‘1’ or ‘2’ is always considered a failure.\nThere are two main types of Special Saves; Aegis and Regeneration, each explained in more detail in the  Model Rules section. A model is only allowed to roll one Special Save roll for each attack."

The Facing that corresponds to this Arc is the Target Facing. See Definitions and Terminology chapter for definitions of Arcs and Facings.\nA Charge Move is then resolved using a single Snaking Forward Move (see Movement Phase chapter for details), with an unlimited distance. During this move, the Charging Unit must move contact with its intended target - The Charging Unit’s Front Facing against the Target Facing.\nCharge Moves are allowed to end the move within 1\" of Impassable Terrain or other units, but are not allowed to move into contact with any enemy unit, other than the target of the Charge.\nOnce the Charging Unit touches its Target Facing, it performs an Align Move. This is done by picking up the Charging Unit and placing it back on the board aligned with the target unit, in a way that keeps the initial point of contact on the charged unit still in contact, while maximising the number of models in contact. See the Reference Handbook for details on how to prioritise the Align Move in complex situations.\nApply the rules below when performing Align Moves. The Charge Move must be made in such a way that the Charging Unit can satisfy the conditions below as best as possible, in decreasing order of priority:\n-   The initial point of contact* on the target unit, before the Align Move, must remain in contact* after the Align Move. Note that the charging model that initially made contact is not required to remain in contact*.\n-   If there is no single initial point of contact*, e.g. because the initial contact*is made along a line, the owner of the Charging Unit declares where the initial point of contact* is, among the possible points of initial contact*. This choice must be made such that the conditions below are satisfied as best as possible.\n-   The Charging Unit is placed fully aligned with its Front Facing flush against the Target Facing.\n-   If this is not possible, apply the rules for Unaligned Charges (see below).\n-   The number of models in the target unit that are in contact* must be maximised. This includes Fighting Over Gaps.\n-   The number of models in the Charging Unit that are in contact* must be maximised. This includes Fighting Over Gaps.\nIf it is unavoidable to break one or more of the above conditions, prioritise maintaining the higher priority conditions, even if it means breaking a greater number of conditions in total. The Charging Unit must, if able to, perform its Charge Move so that the models involved in the initial contact* satisfies the conditions above as best as possible. As long as all the above conditions are satisfied to the best extent possible, the owner has the freedom to choose how to perform the Align Move.\nReferenceManualColorExample of a Charge Move. From left to right.1. Declare Charge: Unit A Declares a Charge towards unit B.\n2. Initial Forward: Unit A moves straight forward.\n3. Wheel: The unit is rotated forward around its front right corner.\n4. Concluding Forward: Unit A moves forward again, until it contacts unit B.\n5. Align: Unit A is picked up and put back down in contact and fully aligned with unit B.\nNow me and Fleabag, when we’re working a mark, our most reliable method is the old one-two. It’s a classic for a reason. Go straight in and try to pinch the goods on your lonesome, you’re asking for a pointed intryductshin to a boot or five. But if the hound creeps up one way, and Klepa sidles over from behind, I can often have a leeesurely peroosal of pockets and purses before they know a thing. Teamwork makes the dream work – or as we Warborn say, broodwork makes the mood work!\nUnaligned Charges\nIf the Charging Unit cannot perform an Align Move to where it is both fully aligned with the enemy and the initial point of contact* remains in contact (Align Move conditions 1 and 2), apply the following rules instead.The Charge Move and Align Move(s) for Unaligned Charges must be made in such a way that the initial point of contact on the target unit, before the initial Align Move, must remain in contact after the initial Align Move, and at the end of both Align Moves, the Front Facing does not pass over the projected line that runs parallel with the Target Facing.\nThis is marked in red in figure 2, step 1.\nAfter making sure that the Charge will be possible without breaking above condition, the Charging Unit must satisfy the conditions below as best as possible, in decreasing order of priority:\n-   The initial point of contact on the target unit, before the initial Align Move, must remain in contact* after the initial Align Move.\nNote that the charging model that initially made contact is not required to remain in contact.\n-   Minimise the angle between the Front Facing of the Charging Unit and the Target Facing.\n-   The number of models in the target unit that are in contact* must be maximised.\n-   The number of models in the Charging Unit that are in contact* must be maximised.\n*Contact here is referring to Base Contact between Unit Boundaries, including Fighting Over Gaps.\nAfter performing the initial Align Move, the target unit performs a special Align Move. It is picked up and rotated around the point of contact, such that the angle between the Charging Unit's Front Facing and the Target Facing is further minimised, possibly bringing the units into being fully aligned.\nNote: Any units not fully aligned must attempt to Combat Reform whenever possible. See Melee chapter for details.\nCombined Charges\nWhen more than one unit has declared a Charge against the same enemy unit, Chargers are moved in a slightly different order.\n-   Roll Charge Range for each unit Charging that same target before moving any of them.\n-   Decide the order that the units will be moved, both Charge Moves and failed Charge Moves. This order must be chosen so that the number of units that successfully completes a charge is as high as possible.\n-   Move the units, one by one, following the normal Charge Move rules with the following exceptions:\n-   Never apply the rules for Unaligned Charges or Blocked Path. If it is not possible to place the Charging Unit fully aligned with the enemy, the charge is considered impossible.\n-   Each individual unit is not required to maximize the number of models in contact (conditions 4 and 5). Instead, apply these conditions at the end of all Charge Moves. This means that the total number of models from both sides are maximized after all successful charges have been performed.\n-   In situations where not all the charging units can complete the Charge Move, e.g. due to other units blocking the path, such units will perform a Failed Charge move instead.\n\nBlocked Path\nTo prevent abusive situations where a unit cannot Charge a nearby enemy unit due to a convoluted positioning of enemy units the following rules are applied.\nBlocked Path can be applied against enemy units that fulfill all of the following criteria:\n-   The enemy unit is directly in front of your unit. This means that the first obstacle (other unit or Impassable Terrain) that a straight forward move of your unit would hit is the enemy unit, and\n-   Your unit would be unable to perform a Charge Move to get into contact with the Target Facing of the enemy unit.\n-   The Charge is not made impossible due to friendly units Engaged with the Target Facing of the enemy unit (i.e. Blocked Path is not applicable if the Charge is made impossible due to your own units being Engaged with the Target Facing\nIn this situation, your unit may Declare a Charge against the enemy unit, and if the enemy does not Flee,  use the Facing that is adjecent to the Target Facing and closest to the Charging Unit (and perform a Charge Move as normal against this chosen Target Facing)."

See <u><link=\"definitions_and_terminology\">Definitions and Terminology</link></u> chapter for definitions of Arcs and Facings.\nA <u><link=\"charge_move\">Charge Move</link></u> is then resolved using a single <u><link=\"snaking_forward_move\">Snaking Forward Move</link></u> (see <u><link=\"movement_phase\">Movement Phase</link></u> chapter for details), with an unlimited distance. During this move, the Charging Unit must move contact with its intended target - The Charging Unit’s Front Facing against the Target Facing.\n<u><link=\"charge_moves\">Charge Moves</link></u> are allowed to end the move within 1\" of <u><link=\"impassable_terrain\">Impassable Terrain</link></u> or other units, but are not allowed to move into contact with any enemy unit, other than the target of the Charge.\nOnce the Charging Unit touches its Target Facing, it performs an Align Move. This is done by picking up the Charging Unit and placing it back on the board aligned with the target unit, in a way that keeps the initial point of contact on the charged unit still in contact, while maximising the number of <u><link=\"model\">models</link></u> in contact. See the Reference Handbook for details on how to prioritise the Align Move in complex situations.\nApply the rules below when performing Align Moves. The <u><link=\"charge_move\">Charge Move</link></u> must be made in such a way that the Charging Unit can satisfy the conditions below as best as possible, in decreasing order of priority:\n-   The initial point of contact* on the target unit, before the Align Move, must remain in contact* after the Align Move. Note that the charging <u><link=\"model\">model</link></u> that initially made contact is not required to remain in contact*.\n-   If there is no single initial point of contact*, e.g. because the initial contact*is made along a line, the owner of the Charging Unit declares where the initial point of contact* is, among the possible points of initial contact*. This choice must be made such that the conditions below are satisfied as best as possible.\n-   The Charging Unit is placed fully aligned with its Front Facing flush against the Target Facing.\n-   If this is not possible, apply the rules for <u><link=\"unaligned_charges\">Unaligned Charges</link></u> (see below).\n-   The number of <u><link=\"model\">models</link></u> in the target unit that are in contact* must be maximised. This includes Fighting Over Gaps.\n-   The number of <u><link=\"model\">models</link></u> in the Charging Unit that are in contact* must be maximised. This includes Fighting Over Gaps.\nIf it is unavoidable to break one or more of the above conditions, prioritise maintaining the higher priority conditions, even if it means breaking a greater number of conditions in total. The Charging Unit must, if able to, perform its <u><link=\"charge_move\">Charge Move</link></u> so that the <u><link=\"model\">models</link></u> involved in the initial contact* satisfies the conditions above as best as possible. As long as all the above conditions are satisfied to the best extent possible, the owner has the freedom to choose how to perform the Align Move.\nReferenceManualColorExample of a <u><link=\"charge_move\">Charge Move</link></u>. From left to right.1. Declare Charge: Unit A Declares a Charge towards unit B.\n2. Initial Forward: Unit A moves straight forward.\n3. Wheel: The unit is rotated forward around its front right corner.\n4. Concluding Forward: Unit A moves forward again, until it contacts unit B.\n5. Align: Unit A is picked up and put back down in contact and fully aligned with unit B.\nNow me and Fleabag, when we’re working a mark, our most reliable method is the old one-two. It’s a classic for a reason. Go straight in and try to pinch the goods on your lonesome, you’re asking for a pointed intryductshin to a boot or five. But if the hound creeps up one way, and Klepa sidles over from behind, I can often have a leeesurely peroosal of pockets and purses before they know a thing. Teamwork makes the dream work – or as we Warborn say, broodwork makes the mood work!"
