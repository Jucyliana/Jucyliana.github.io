However, there is an exception: the unit may still choose to Flee! or Hold! As a Charge Reaction.\nRemember that if unit is Shaken, it temporarily stops being Scoring. This lasts until it is no longer Shaken.\nShaken units that are Engaged in Combat are removed as casualties at step 2.1 of the Round of Combat sequence.\nIn order to remember which units are Shaken, we recommend that Shaken units are clearly marked. This can either be done with specific markers or tokens to indicate a unit is Shaken, or if you do not have such markers, a commonly used method for marking Shaken units is to put one model from the Front Rank of the Shaken unit, and lie face down next to the unit."

    "Description": "A unit must take a Dangerous Terrain Test at the end of the move, if it has been in contact with Dangerous Terrain during one the following moves: March Move, Charge Move, Failed Charge Move, Flee Move, or Pursue Move.\nDangerous Terrain Tests are performed by rolling a number of D6. For each roll of ‘X+’, the unit suffers a hit that wounds automatically with AP 10.\nThe number of Dangerous Terrain Tests a unit must roll is equal to half the number of models in the unit, rounding fractions up, and multiplied by the models’ Height. If ‘Y’ is written, only models fulfilling these criteria take a Dangerous Terrain Test. For example, a unit of 19 Height 1 Clan Warriors would roll 10 Dangerous Terrain Tests, while a unit of a single Height 5 Dragon would roll 5 Dangerous Terrain Tests. (For units with Attached models see the Reference Handbook.)\nIf one of the above-mentioned moves was performed by a unit, and it has been in contact with several Terrain Features that are Dangerous Terrain, all Health Pools in it must make a Dangerous Terrain Test, for each Terrain Feature with Dangerous Terrain it has been in contact with, one at a time, removing any casualties caused by the first tests before calculating the number of dice that must be rolled for the next test. If a type of model is indicated in the brackets (X), any model not fulfilling this criteria is considered Height 0 for Dangerous Terrain Test purposes.\n\nIf a unit has multiple Health Pools, treat each of these separately for Dangerous Terrain. This means that:\n\n-   Only Health Pools that have been in contact with the Terrain Feature need to roll Dangerous Terrain Tests.\n-   Calculate the number of Dangerous Terrain Tests to roll for each Health Pool that has been in contact with the Terrain Feature, and roll the tests separately. Damage from these tests is allocated towards the Health Pool that the tests were rolled for.\nFor example, a unit of 10 Height 1 Rank-and-File models is joined by two Characters of Height 2. If the unit moves through Dangerous Terrain in such way that one of the Characters never touches the Terrain Features, Dangerous Terrain Tests are rolled in the following way: 5 tests for the Rank-and-File Health Pool, 2 tests for the Character that touched the Terrain Feature, and no tests for the other Character."

When a unit moves in the Movement Phase, it must select which Move Manoeuvres it will perform:\n-   Advance Move, \n-   March Move, or\n-   Reform Move.\nRemember that since you are allowed to perform any measurements at any time, it's possible to test a Move Manoeuvre, realise it was not a great idea, and then immediately backtrack and perform a different Move Manoeuvre, unless random events or decisions by the opponent has happened that could influence the decision. It is also customary to mark the starting position, so that backtracking is possible to do accurately.\n\nReform Moves is where a unit tactically adjusts their arrangement on the field, granting them the strategic edge to adapt to new challenges during battle. This controlled shift is used to optimise positioning, formation and facing, white staying mostly in the same spot. \\\nAdvance Moves provide units with the freedom to manoeuvre on the battlefield, making it a versatile choice for repositioning when preparing to engage with the enemy.\\\nMarch Moves are the fastest but least flexible movement option available to a unit. It allows the unit to move quickly in a forward direction.\nValid Final Position\nFor the final position of the unit to be considered a valid position, regardless of which Move Manoeuvre was performed, the following condition must be met. If not, the Move Manoeuvre cannot be performed.\n-   Each corner of the unit’s end position must be within twice its Mobility value (2xMob inches) of at least one corner’s starting position. Note that a  corner need  not be within 2xMob inches of the same corner's starting position.\nFor simplicity, measure the corner that is furthest away from the starting position, and measure towards the starting position of the closest corner.\n\n\nReferenceManualColorExample of how to measure Valid Final PositionThe unit moves forward and wheels to face right. When reaching the end position, make sure that the corner that travelled furthest is still within 2xMob of at least one of the corners of the unit's starting position (marked in red dashed line in the figure).\n\n\nAdvance Move\nWhen performing an Advance Move, execute the following actions in the order given below:\n1 -  Pivot: The Advance Move is initiated with a Pivot. At the end of this pivot, the unit must follow the Unit Spacing rule (note that since this is partway through a move, the unit may normally be up to within 0.5\" from other units).\n2 -  Snaking Forward Move (Mob): After the Pivot, the unit may do  any number of Snaking Forward Moves, with a distance no more than equal to its Mobility (in inches). While performing these Snaking Forward Moves, the direction the unit is facing must stay within 90 degrees (in either direction) from the direction the unit was facing after the Pivot.\n3 -  Reorder: Models may be repositioned within the unit, as long as the number of files does not change.\nMarch Move\nWhen performing a March Move, execute the following actions in the order given below:\n1 -  Snaking Forward Move (2xMob): The unit may do any number of Snaking Forward Moves, with a total distance no more than equal to twice its Mobility (in inches).

Remember that the unit cannot voluntarily have more Ranks than Files unless the unit is wide enough to have a Proper Rank (see Models and Units in the Definitions and Terminology chapter).\n-   Each model is considered to have moved from its starting position to end position, around obstructions where needed, and no single model can move further than twice its Mobility.\nWhen measuring each model's move, it is considered to move independently of its unit, in any direction or combination of directions, including side- and back-stepping. The models can ignore other models from the same unit, but not from other units. No single model can move further than twice its Mobility. Measure the centre of each model's base, and measure the path the model moves on the Battlefield, from starting to ending position, including the path winding around obstacles.\nTreat each model as an individual unit following the Unit Spacing rule. At the end of this move, all models come back together again into a viable formation as described above.\nReferenceManualColorSimplified Reform Move\\\nIn practice, for the vast majority of Reform and Advance Moves, there is no  need to consider the movements of individual models.\\\nThe Upper example shows the technical way to perform a Reform Move; moving models one by one (grey dotted lines), and measuring distance the centre moved (black dotted line). \\\nThe Lower image show a simplified method to perform a Reform Move: Move the unit as a whole, potentially readjusting formation by adding or removing files.

Melee Weapons are used with the model part’s Standard Melee Attacks.\n\n-   Modifiers to Offensive Characteristics and Attack Attributes are applied only to the model part’s Standard Melee Attacks.\n-   Modifiers to Global or Defensive Characteristics (Mob, Cha, Cou, Def, HP, Res, or Arm), and Model Rules that are not Attack Attributes, are applied to the model or model part (see rules for Character Mounts for details when and how Characteristics of mounts are affected) at all times except while using a different Melee Weapon.\n-   Variable bonuses, such as those based on a dice roll, are determined at the start of the Agility Step in which the weapon is used.\n\n\n-   Shooting Weapon: Shooting Weapons are used for making Shooting Attacks. Each model part can only use one Shooting Weapon per phase. A Shooting Weapon typically has an Aim Value, shown in brackets after the name of the weapon. The rules for the Shooting Weapon will define the weapon’s maximum Range, the number of Shots fired, and the Strength, Armour Penetration, and potentially Attack Attributes applied to its attacks."

    "Description": "Spells are divided into two types.\n-   Learned Spells: The most common type, these are cast using the full power of the Veil.\n-   Bound Spells: Bound into an object or creature and more stable than Learned spells, since they are cast using only parts of the Veil. These are cast by all manner of creatures, as well as some Wizards.\nMost spells belong to a specific Path of Magic (see  the Arcane Compendium), or are an Hereditary spell unique to each Army Book.\n\nCasting and Dispelling\nEach of Active Player's models with one or more spells can attempt to cast each spell up to once per Magic Phase. (Remember that Shaken models cannot cast spells.) The sequence for casting a spell is as follows:\nWell no, I’m not a magician myself; I am a scholar, and one of the finest minds in Avras, I’ll have you know! And I have read all there is to know about magic, including the drivel that Heisermann calls his magnum opus.\nAny true wizard will tell you that magic comes at a cost; too much of the stuff is lethal. It’s a mutagenic poison, after all. A withering, corrupting substance. And those with the proper training can feel the limits of what their body can tolerate instinctively – they cannot use more than is good for them any more than you could stop breathing.\n1012Casting Roll - Active Player\n1 -  Caster and target: Declare which model is casting what spell, and choose target(s) for the spell. See Spell Types in the  Arcane Compendium for details.\n2 -  Spend Magic Dice to cast: Declare how many Magic Dice are spent on the Casting Roll (between 2 - 5 Magic Dice can be used)\n3 -  Roll Dice: Roll the Magic Dice used for the Casting Roll, and add the results together. If the total is equal to or above the spell’s Casting Value, the casting is successful. Otherwise, the Casting Roll failed, go directly to step 7.\n-   Fizzle: If one or more  ‘1’ was rolled, and the Casting Roll was not successful, each dice that rolled a  ‘1’ is added back to the Magic Dice pool.\n-   Miscast: If three or more Magic Dice, or two Magic Dice if using only two dice, used for the Casting Roll gave an identical result, and the Casting Roll is successful, and the spell is not dispelled, the Caster suffers a Miscast. Consult the Miscast Table for further instructions.\n1012Dispelling Roll - Reactive Player\n4 -  Spend Magic Dice to dispel: The Reactive Player may try to Dispel the Spell. If not, go directly to step 6. If the Reactive Player chooses to try the dispelling, declare how many Magic Dice are spent on the Dispelling Roll. Note that there are no limits to how many or how few Magic Dice the Reactive Player may use for this.\n5 -  Dispelling Roll: Roll the Magic Dice used for the Dispelling Roll, and add the results together. If the total is equal to or above the Casting Roll, the dispel is successful, proceed to step 7. Otherwise, the Dispelling Roll failed, proceed to step 6.\n-   Fizzle: If one or more ‘1’ was rolled,  and the Dispelling Roll was not successful, each dice that rolled a ‘1’ is added back to the Magic Dice pool.\n1012Resolving the spell effect\n6 -  Apply spell Effects: If the Casting Roll was successful, and the spell was not not dispelled, it is successfully cast. Apply the spell Effects.\nSpell effects are never affected by any effects affecting the Caster, including Magic Items, Model Rules, other Spell effects, or similar abilities, unless specifically stated otherwise.\n7 -  Next Casting: Afterward, the Active Player may attempt to cast other spells, provided there are enough Magic Dice left.\nCasting Multiple Instances of the same Spell\nEach Caster can only try to cast each of its Learned Spells once per Magic Phase, and it may try to cast a Bound Spell once for each time it has it. If multiple Casters knows the same Spell, all of them may try to cast their instance(s) of the Spell.\nWhen making an attempt to cast a Learned Spell where a version of the same spell (either Bound or Learned) has already been attempted (successfully or not), then the Casting Roll reduced by 3. This is reduced by another 3 for each additional attempt in the same phase. For example, if 2 instances of a spell have been attempted, the Casting Roll is reduced by 6.\nIf instead attempting to cast a Bound Spell, the Casting Roll is only reduced by 1, instead of by 3, for each time a version of the same spell has already been tried.\nRemember that Replicable Spells ignore this modifier but still count as a casting.\nBound Spells\nCasting and Dispelling Bound Spells follow the normal procedure for Casting a Learned Spell, with the following exceptions:\n-   When trying to cast a Bound Spell one Magic Die is a D6, the rest are D3. For example, if Casting a Bound Spell with 3 Magic Dice, roll 1D6 and 2D3.\n-   A rolled D3 can never fizzle.\n-   Bound Spells have their own Casting Values, defined in the brackets following Bound Spell.\n-   Bound Spells can never Miscast.\nWhen Casting a Bound Spell version of a Learned Spell that was already cast in the same Magic Phase, the Casting Roll is decreased only by 1 (instead of by 3).\nNote: When Casting a Learned Spell version of a Bound Spell that was already cast in the same Magic Phase, the Casting Roll is decreased by 3, as usual.  This is ignored if the Bound Spell is Replicable.\nBound Spells are designed to offer low-resource and low-risk casting opportunities to the players. They typically require fewer dice for casting and never cause Miscasts. However, they are also easier to dispel. As a result, Bound Spells are the perfect tool when the opponent is out of Magic Dice for dispelling.\nWhen casting Bound Spells, it is important to clearly differentiate between the D6 and D3 dice. Announce to the opponent how you roll your dice, and either roll them separately, use differently coloured dice, or use dedicated D3-only dice."

Ignore other Pursuing units.\n-   Which Arc the Pursuing unit is Located in for each enemy unit that may be Charged later in this process. If the Pursuit Move will lead to a Charge, it will be in the Facing determined at this point.\nThe Charging units will be moved first, in the order that best satisfies the Combined Charges rules (see Charge Phase chapter). Afterwards the remaining Pursuing units will be moved, in an order chosen by their owner.\n1. Pivot\nIf the unit is performing an Overrun, ignore this step; the unit always moves straight forward without Pivoting.\nThe Pursuing unit Pivots so that it is facing the same direction as the Pursued unit, or if  removed as a casualty, the direction the Pursued unit would have had, had it not been  removed as a casualty. Ignore the Unit Spacing rule during this Pivot.\nAfter the Pivot, one of the four situations below will arise. If more than one is applicable, apply the uppermost one.\n-   Enemy unit: If the Front Facing of the Pursuing unit would be in contact with the Unit Boundary of an enemy unit that did not Flee from the same Combat, it declares a Charge against that unit, which can not perform any Charge Reactions.  If there is more than one possible target, the Pivoting unit chooses which unit to Charge.\nTo perform the Charge move, Remove the Pursuing unit from the Battlefield, and then place it back following the rules below:\n-   It cannot change formation, \n-   Its Front Facing is in contact with its target Facing determined before the Pivot, \n-   The centre of the Pursuing unit moves as short a distance as possible from its position before the Pivot, while still allowing a legal position following the Unit Spacing Rule after the Align Move.\nAfterwards, perform the initial Align Move (see Charge Phase chapter). If there is not enough room to place the Pursuing unit in contact, treat the enemy unit as an Obstruction instead.\n-   Table Edge: If the Front Facing of the unit is in contact with, or outside, the Table Edge, the unit performs a Post-Combat Pivot and then moves no further (i.e. ignore step 2. Forward Ahead). If it is not possible to perform this Post-Combat Pivot in a way that puts the unit in a legal end position, treat the Table Edge as an Obstruction instead.\n-   Obstruction: If the Front Facing of the Pursuing unit would be in contact with an Obstruction, the unit instead Pivots so that it faces a direction as close as possible towards the same direction that the Pursued unit is facing, while following the Unit Spacing rule (normally this means stopping 1\" away from the Obstruction). The unit moves no further (i.e. ignore step 2. Forward Ahead).\n-   Free to move: If the Front Facing of the Pursuing unit touches neither of the above, proceed to the 2. Forward Ahead step.\n\n2. Forward Ahead\nWithout moving the Pursuing unit, check what the first obstacle (Table Edge, Enemy Unit Boundary, or Obstruction) would be, within the rectangle formed by extending its Front Facing directly ahead of the unit a distance equal to the previously rolled Pursue Distance. If more than one is applicable, apply the uppermost one.\nThe Unit Spacing rule is ignored when doing this check and for all movement during Forward Ahead.\n-   Enemy unit: If the first obstacle would be the Unit Boundary of an enemy unit that did not Flee from the same Combat, the Pursuing unit declares a Charge against that unit using its Pursuit Distance roll as its Charge Range. If there is more than one possible target, the Pursuing unit chooses which to Charge. The Charged unit may not perform any Charge Reactions.\nThe Pursuing unit immediately performs a Charge Move towards the previously determined Facing, following all the normal Charge Move and Align Move rules described in the Charge Phase chapter, (including Unaligned Charge and Blocked Path if applicable). If the Charge is not possible to complete, the unit does not perform a Failed Charge Move but treats the enemy unit as Obstruction instead, see below.\nIf the Pursuing unit joins a Combat that has already been fought or was created during this Melee Phase, it will be resolved in the next Melee Phase, with the Charging unit still counting as Charging. If the Pursuing unit joins a Combat that was not created during this Melee Phase and that has not been fought yet, the unit will have a chance to fight and Pursue again this phase.\n-   Table Edge: If the first obstacle would be the Table Edge, move the unit straight forward until it touches the Table Edge, and then immediately perform a Post-Combat Pivot.\n-   Obstruction : If the first obstacle would be an Obstruction, move the unit straight forward until just before it enters base contact with the Obstruction.\n-   Free to move: If the Front Facing of the Pursuing unit touches neither of the above,  move the unit straight forward its Pursuit Distance.\n\n3. Legal Position?\nAt the end of the Pursue Move, check if the unit is in a legal position following the Unit Spacing rule. It cannot be in contact with an enemy unit it did not declare a Charge against, but can be within 0.5\" of units and Impassable Terrain , this  includes friendly units that were part of the same Combat. If the unit is not in a legal position, at the end of the move, backtrack the move to the unit's last legal position where it follows the Unit Spacing rule.\nExample of two units\nPursuing into the same enemy unit.a) Unit D loses the Combat, Breaks, and Flees 7\". The owner of the winning units chooses to roll for unit A’s Pursuit Distance first. 6\" is not enough to catch the Fleeing unit. Unit B’s Pursuit Distance is 7\", so it is equal to or higher than unit D’s Flee Distance: the Fleeing unit is immediately  removed as a casualty. Unit C's Pursuit Distance is 5\".\\\\\nb) When checking which units will Charge an enemy unit during their Pursuit, before moving any Pursuing unit, it turns out that both unit A and unit B will Charge unit E, so both units declare a Charge against unit E. Unit C will not Charge any enemy units. \\\\\nc) Now units A and B perform their Pursuit Moves first. During this move, they can move through one another ignoring the Unit Spacing rule. Otherwise, they move using the normal rules for Charge Moves (one Wheel allowed, Maximising Contact). In order to maximise the number of models and units in base contact, unit A aligns its Front Facing with unit E’s, while unit B moves into corner to corner contact with unit E. Afterwards unit C Pivots and moves its Pursuit Distance straight forward."

If the Special Save is failed, or the model does not have a Special Save, a wound is inflicted. Proceed to Losing Health Points and Casualties.\n\nArmour Saves\nThe defender rolls Armour Saves, by rolling a D6 for each wound, and comparing the result with the model’s Armour Value, reduced by the Attack's Armour Penetration.\nThe modified Armour Value describes the number of sides on a D6, counting down from the highest value, that will result in a successful roll, see tables below. If the Armor Save is successful, the wound is ignored. However, a natural roll of ‘1’ is considered a failure.\nArm - AP    Armour Save Roll\n5 or above    2+\n4    3+\n3    4+\n2    5+\n1    6+\n0    Cannot be passed  \nAP 0    AP 1    AP 2    AP 3    AP 4    AP 5    AP 6\nArm 0    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A\nArm 1    6+    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A\nArm 2    5+    6+    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A\nArm 3    4+    5+    6+    N/A    N/A    N/A    N/A\nArm 4    3+    4+    5+    6+    N/A    N/A    N/A\nArm 5    2+    3+    4+    5+    6+    N/A    N/A\nArm 6    2+    2+    3+    4+    5+    6+    N/A  \nFor example, Armour 3, means that ‘6’, ‘5’, and ‘4’ would be successful Armour Save rolls. If the model is attacked by Armour Penetration 1, its Armour is reduced to Armour 2, which now means that ‘6’ and ‘5’ are successful Armour Save rolls. \nThis is equivalent with using the formula below to determine the required roll to negate the wound:\n7 - (Defender’s Armor)\n+ (Attacker’s Armour Penetration)\nCombined Armour\nEach model has a base Armour value in its profile, and some models may have additional equipment, rules, or are under the effect of spells that modify the Armour values. Different sources of Armour can be combined, adding up to the total combined Armour.\nFor example, a model with a base Armour of 3 that is under the effect of a spell that grants +1 Armour, has a combined Armour of 4. When wounded by an attack with Armour Penetration 1, the Armour Save roll would be ‘4’, ‘5’, or ‘6’ (or 4+).\nSpecial Saves\nIf a wound is not saved by the Armour Save, the defender may negate the attack with its Special Save, if it has one. Special Saves work like Armour saves, except they are unaffected by Armour Penetration.\nA natural roll of ‘1’ or ‘2’ is always considered a failure.\nThere are two main types of Special Saves; Aegis and Regeneration, each explained in more detail in the  Model Rules section. A model is only allowed to roll one Special Save roll for each attack."

The Facing that corresponds to this Arc is the Target Facing.

This is done by picking up the Charging Unit and placing it back on the board aligned with the target unit, in a way that keeps the initial point of contact on the charged unit still in contact, while maximising the number of models in contact. See the Reference Handbook for details on how to prioritise the Align Move in complex situations.\nApply the rules below when performing Align Moves. The Charge Move must be made in such a way that the Charging Unit can satisfy the conditions below as best as possible, in decreasing order of priority:\n-   The initial point of contact* on the target unit, before the Align Move, must remain in contact* after the Align Move. Note that the charging model that initially made contact is not required to remain in contact*.\n-   If there is no single initial point of contact*, e.g. because the initial contact*is made along a line, the owner of the Charging Unit declares where the initial point of contact* is, among the possible points of initial contact*. This choice must be made such that the conditions below are satisfied as best as possible.\n-   The Charging Unit is placed fully aligned with its Front Facing flush against the Target Facing.\n-   If this is not possible, apply the rules for Unaligned Charges (see below).\n-   The number of models in the target unit that are in contact* must be maximised. This includes Fighting Over Gaps.\n-   The number of models in the Charging Unit that are in contact* must be maximised. This includes Fighting Over Gaps.\nIf it is unavoidable to break one or more of the above conditions, prioritise maintaining the higher priority conditions, even if it means breaking a greater number of conditions in total. The Charging Unit must, if able to, perform its Charge Move so that the models involved in the initial contact* satisfies the conditions above as best as possible.

It is picked up and rotated around the point of contact, such that the angle between the Charging Unit's Front Facing and the Target Facing is further minimised, possibly bringing the units into being fully aligned.\nNote: Any units not fully aligned must attempt to Combat Reform whenever possible. See Melee chapter for details.\nCombined Charges\nWhen more than one unit has declared a Charge against the same enemy unit, Chargers are moved in a slightly different order.\n-   Roll Charge Range for each unit Charging that same target before moving any of them.\n-   Decide the order that the units will be moved, both Charge Moves and failed Charge Moves. This order must be chosen so that the number of units that successfully completes a charge is as high as possible.\n-   Move the units, one by one, following the normal Charge Move rules with the following exceptions:\n-   Never apply the rules for Unaligned Charges or Blocked Path. If it is not possible to place the Charging Unit fully aligned with the enemy, the charge is considered impossible.\n-   Each individual unit is not required to maximize the number of models in contact (conditions 4 and 5). Instead, apply these conditions at the end of all Charge Moves. This means that the total number of models from both sides are maximized after all successful charges have been performed.\n-   In situations where not all the charging units can complete the Charge Move, e.g. due to other units blocking the path, such units will perform a Failed Charge move instead.\n\nBlocked Path\nTo prevent abusive situations where a unit cannot Charge a nearby enemy unit due to a convoluted positioning of enemy units the following rules are applied.\nBlocked Path can be applied against enemy units that fulfill all of the following criteria:\n-   The enemy unit is directly in front of your unit. This means that the first obstacle (other unit or Impassable Terrain) that a straight forward move of your unit would hit is the enemy unit, and\n-   Your unit would be unable to perform a Charge Move to get into contact with the Target Facing of the enemy unit.\n-   The Charge is not made impossible due to friendly units Engaged with the Target Facing of the enemy unit (i.e. Blocked Path is not applicable if the Charge is made impossible due to your own units being Engaged with the Target Facing\nIn this situation, your unit may Declare a Charge against the enemy unit, and if the enemy does not Flee,  use the Facing that is adjecent to the Target Facing and closest to the Charging Unit (and perform a Charge Move as normal against this chosen Target Facing)."

Each Army Book contains a description of the different units that are available to its faction, as well as their characteristics and special rules that apply to them.<br><br>To start building your army, you create an Army List, which includes the selection of units, spells and options you want to use along with their point costs.

Each Army Category has its own points limit, as defined in the Army Book, determining how many points a player can allocate to that particular category. This allows players to create a balanced and strategic army composition for their games.<br><br>\t<br>\t<br>\t<br><br>characterCharactersThis category typically allows players to spend up to 40% of the Army Size. All entries that belong to this Category follow the rules for Characters and Attachable Models.Characters are the leaders and exceptional individuals in the army, wielding various skills such as brute force, tactical acumen, spellcasting ability, or engineering knowledge. They play a crucial role in influencing the outcome of battles, and one of them usually  serves as the army's General, responsible for leading and inspiring your forces.<br><br>coreCoreThis Army Category always has a minimum amount of points that must be spent on it, usually 25% of the Army Size.<br><br>Core units represent the most readily available warriors in the faction, serving as essential rank-and-file troops under the command of the Characters. They are always present in some combination as part of your fighting force.specialSpecialThis Army Category has no maximum or minimum limit. You are free to spend any amount of points on units in this Category.<br><br>The Special Army Category represents less common and more unique forces that are found in some but not all of your faction's armies. While they might make up the largest portion of your host, the availability of each unit is still limited. They generally fill a range of useful and impactful roles.<br><br>EoSArmy-SpecificThis Army Category has a maximum amount of points that can be spent on it; the limit is defined within individual Army Books.<br><br>Army-Specific Categories introduce additional options and limitations in army building, reflecting the nature of the faction. Army-Specific Categories can include thematic groupings of units, limitations based on specific functions, and sometimes the faction’s most rare and powerful forces.<br><br><h5>Belonging to more than one Army Category</h5><br>Some units can be included in more than one Army Category, which is represented by more than one icon in their entry. In these cases, simply count the unit’s Point Cost towards the limits of all its Army Categories, but only once towards the army’s Point Cost.<br><br><h5>Adding Army Categories to a Unit</h5><br>Choosing certain options can make a unit count towards another Army Category in addition to its original Army Category. For example, giving a unit Shooting Weapons might make it also count towards the Ranged Support Army Category. This is marked by a small icon of the additional Army Category, displayed underneath the original Army Category icon(s), together with the conditions for counting towards this additional Army Category.<br><br><h5>Splitting Point Cost between Army Categories</h5><br>In some rare cases, a unit’s Point Cost can be split between different Army Categories, where the Point Cost for some particular option is additionally counted towards a different Army Category than the unit. This is marked in the unit entry by a split icon, with the two halves representing the two Army Categories the unit counts towards.<br><br><i>For example, a 250 pts Elf Character, counted towards the Characters Army Category, decides to ride a 500 pts Dragon, which is an option marked to count additionally towards Beasts and Monsters. In this case, the player must count the entire unit’s Point Cost (250 + 500 = 750 pts) towards Characters, and the Dragon’s Point Cost (500 pts) towards “Beasts and Monsters”. Here too, of course, only 750 pts are added towards the army’s total limit.</i><br><br><h5>Rarity - Restrictions for Units and Items</h5><br><br>Certain units and options in the army have limitations on how many times they can be included.<br><br>\t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  <span class=\"textbf\">Maximum Points cost</span>: Unless mentioned otherwise, no unit can have a points cost above 600 points.  A unit entry with a different maximum points cost different than this, follows its own defined limits instead. <i>For example, a unit with (max. 800 pts) listed next to its unit size limits can cost up to 800 points.</i><br><br>\t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  <span class=\"textbf\">Max.

But one goblin, faverit of cunning Karuka, she pays a visit to the mean old wizard the night before he comes.

And when he heats his water for a bath, she sends the magic off, so he has to wash cold. When he makes the broom come to life to clean his chamber, she makes it stumble and fall down. Madder and madder, finally he tries biggest spell he knows. Clever goblin lets it go, and the magic shakes the whole tower into rubble, with the nasty wizard inside, squished.

Most warriors combine to form disciplined regiments called units, and several such units form the  foundation of your army.</i><br><br><h5>Model</h5> A single gaming piece placed on a base. Each model has its own profile, which consists of a statline of values, model rules, and equipment. The profile reflects the capabilities of the model.<br><br><h5>Rank-and-File model</h5> Normal models in a unit. All models, except Attachable Models (<i>such as all Characters</i>), are referred to as Rank-and-File models.<br><br><h5>Base</h5> The platform on which a playing piece rests. Bases are rectangular and represent the area of the battlefield occupied by the model. In the game rules, the base is the only physical aspect of the model that matters. Bases are measured in front-width × side-length, e.g., 25×50 mm for most horse riders.<br><br><h5>Unit</h5> A group of one or more models that operate as a single entity, arranged in a rectangular formation. Models in a unit move and fight together, coordinating their actions on the battlefield.<br><br>When forming a unit of multiple models, the following conditions must be met to form a viable formation;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  The models are placed in a tight rectangular formation and facing the same direction.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  The unit cannot voluntarily have more Ranks than Files unless the unit is wide enough to have a Proper Rank.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  For units that are always considered to have 0 Proper Ranks, such as units entirely with Light Troops, apply this rule as if they could form Proper Ranks (<i>e.g. a Height 1 units entirely with Light Troop cannot have more ranks than files unless at least 5 models wide</i>).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  Note that joining a unit with a Character is considered a voluntary action.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  The models are perfectly aligned and in contact with each other.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  The width of the unit is determined by the first frontmost rank. No models may extend past this width.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  Models not in the first rank must be positioned so that another model is directly in front of them, ensuring the entire front edge of their bases are in contact with the models in front of them.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  All ranks within a unit must have the same width, except for the rear rank, which can be narrower.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  It is acceptable for the rear rank to have gaps, as long as the models are aligned with those in the other ranks.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  An Incomplete Rank refers to a rank with one or more missing models.<br><br>When a rule, ability, spell, or any other effect affects a unit, all models of the unit are affected, unless explicitly stated otherwise.<br><br><h5>Unit Boundary</h5> The Unit Boundary is an imaginary rectangle encompassing the outer edges of a unit. Unit cannot be inside another Unit Boundary, unless the units are explicitly allowed to temporarily be overlapping.<br><br><h5>The Centre of a unit</h5> A unit's centre is located at the centre of its Unit Boundary.<br><br><h5>Facings</h5> A unit or a model has four Facings that correspond to the edges of the Unit Boundary or the model's base; a Front, a Rear, and two Flanks.<br><br><h5>Arcs</h5> A unit's Arcs correspond to the area in front of the four Facings, divided by a straight line extending from the corners of the Unit Boundary at a 135° angle from the unit's Facings.<br><br>\\<br><br>Unit Arcs, Unit Facings, and Unit Boundariesa) This unit has 3 ranks and 5 files.  The rear rank is incomplete and only contains 4 models. The Front, Flank, and Rear Arcs are defined by drawing lines from the corners of the Unit Boundary at a 135  angle from the unit’s Facings.\\<br>b) The Unit Boundary is the area drawn around the outer edges of the unit, shaded red lines. The Centre of the unit is the centre of the Unit Boundary. \\<br>c) A Unit Boundary cannot be inside another Unit Boundary, not even with parts that are not occupied by any models.<br><br><h5>Proper Ranks</h5> The number of models required to form a Proper Rank depends on the unit's Height:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  5 models for Height 0-2, <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  3 models for Height 3-4, and<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;  1 model for Height 5.<br><br><h5>Ranks and Files</h5> Lines of models in the same unit that are side by side are called ranks, and lines of models that are directly in front and behind each other are called files.<br><br><h5>Model Parts</h5> Some models have multiple lines of Offensive Profiles. Each line represents a different Model Part.<br><br><i>For example, a Cavalry model consists of a rider and its mount. If a rule, ability, spell, or effect affects a model, all model parts are affected unless stated otherwise.

After nine long ages of strife, the many peoples and kingdoms of this high fantasy world have acquired highly developed and often spectacular methods of waging war. With so many great and terrible powers throughout the lands, the future is poised and uncertain: Everything could be decided on the outcome of a single battle.<br><br>For the reader who wishes to delve deeper into the lore of the Ninth Age, you can discover more of the wider setting in each Army Book, as well as our background-focused publications: <a href='https://www.the-ninth-age.com/the-world/'>the-ninth-age.com/the-world</a>.<br><br>Among the various cultures, countries, and strange dominions of the world, sixteen great factions are pre-eminent. Each of these powers represents a terrifying military force. Each will attempt to dominate the Ninth Age as they are able, and each has connections that can bring it across the globe. As such, there is never any shortage of reasons for conflict and battle between these mighty armies - as your tabletop games can testify.<br><br>1214.4Few individuals have the chance to see more than a fraction of our world, with its astonishing variety of intelligent races and animal species, plants and cities, cults and wars. I have travelled from Avras to the Kingdom of Vanhu. I’ve seen Sunna’s seeds planted in Virentia and the Great Wall of Tsuandan in the far east of Augea. You could not find another who has travelled a greater distance; I have been protected by the auspice of Sunna, and here I record my knowledge on the geography of our world.<br>Vetia is the land of mankind, where nations of men have reigned for years under the protective sight of the Goddess and her church. There, the powerful nation of Sonnstahl guards all mankind against the dangers of the Wasteland, while to the south the merchant cities of Arcalea ply their trade with the whole of the world. There you will also find the White Mountains, impenetrable hold of the Dwarves. To the west lie the twin cities of Destria, the Kingdom of noble Equitaine, and the enchanted, emerald-green forest of Wyscan, the mysterious dwelling of the sylvan elves.    Augea, the immense sister of Vetia, separated from one another by the great Wasteland, home to the servants of the Dark Gods. Crossing east of Avras into this land, you will travel through the Barren Mountains, where the Steel Road starts its winding journey. Here is the dwelling of the Dwarves of the east, named Infernal. The Steel Road runs parallel to the Silk Road to the north, with access controlled by the Ogre Khans. It leads from the Blasted Plains through the Sky Mountains, across the northern part of the human region of Sagarikadesha, finishing its rich path in the glorious land of Tsuandan, where the Dragon Emperor rules over men.<br>Set sail south from Bellatorre, and in three nights you will reach the docks of Port Reynaud, Equitaine’s holdfast in Taphria. Should you dare it, you will never forget the nights spent in the Great Desert, for they are terrible and fascinating all at once. There, following the path of the Napaat river, lie the remains of a truly ancient kingdom with its legends of never-dying monstrosities. In the west stand the fortresses and souks of Qassar, full of exotic smells and tales of evil spirits, the djinn. In the west and southeast of the continent lie vast kingdoms of men; the Koghi Empire and Kingdom of Vanhu respectively. Finally in its south, the <nuxt-link class=\"ruleLink\" to=\"/app/rule/forests\">forests</nuxt-link> around the Mfumu river are said to hide some of the most ancient secrets of the world.<br>The Great Ocean divides Vetia from the two western continents, Silexia in the north and Virentia in the south. The Ocean itself is the dominion of elves: there the fleets of the two great nations, the Highborn and their dreaded kin, vie for supremacy. Here lies the main motherland of the Highborn Elves, the proud islands of Celeda Ablan, and Silexia where freedom is a commodity to be traded.<br>On the eastern coast of Virentia mankind too, has established colonies: the imperial city of Fredericksberg, and the port of Aguadulce, of Destria. Beyond them, a lush forest of wonderful colors and inconceivable dan- gers hides the secrets of ancient civilizations.
